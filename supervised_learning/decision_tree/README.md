# Decision Tree Depth Project

This project implements a simple Decision Tree class in Python, including:

- Node class
- Leaf class
- Decision_Tree class
- Method `max_depth_below` to compute maximum depth of a tree
- Decision_Tree.depth() method

The code follows Holberton's Python style guidelines and passes all checks.
